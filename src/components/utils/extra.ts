are you working on any of your own ideas rn?
*
could be anything! an app you're making on the side, a new music track, the first chapters of your new book, a startup you are building, whatever.
it's also perfectly fine to not be working on anything rn. a lot of people in nights and weekends are just starting off, so that's perfectly fine :)
are you working on any of your own ideas rn?

yes -- i'm working full-time on my own ideas right now.

yes -- working on my own ideas on the nights & weekends.

no -- i'm not working on my own ideas atm.
cool. what are you working on rn? 1-2 sentences is fine.
*
give us the project's name (if you have one), the one-liner, and what you're trying to do!
im building a school for ppl to become hokage
how far along is your project rn in terms of numbers?
*
we just wanna get a sense of where you are at with it.
ex:
$100 in revenue
10,000 yt subscribers 
1,000 sign-ups
$10k mrr
2,500 monthly listeners 
whatever!
and if you're at zero then that's cool to.
tell us all about any milestones you've hit or things you're proud of in the last 6-12 months in relation to your work, hobby, and/or career.
*
this doesn't need to be polished.
write like 4-5 sentences.
feel free to word vomit. tell us about all the things ex. a round you recently raised, a new skill that took your work to the next level, a big milestone you hit in terms of metrics, etc.
random -- whats the most viral thing you've ever created/done? tell us the story + how many people it got to!
*
virality is subjective to u. if u only made 1 thing ever and it got 10 views. that's huge. just share your story :)
click on the "add images" button on your profile preview pane and drop 3 images that show what you do.
imagine someone could only see 3 pictures to understand what it is you work on/do.
what 3 images do you show?
